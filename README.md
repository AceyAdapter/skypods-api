# SkyPods API

SkyPods API is the backend for the SkyPods project, enabling decentralized micro-communities on Bluesky. It uses **Express.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Postgres** to provide endpoints for managing users, communities (SkyPods), memberships, posts, and moderation.

> **ðŸš§ This project is currently in development.**  
> Features and functionality are subject to change as the API evolves.
